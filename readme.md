## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/preview.png)

Unlike its predecessor, which was built entirely from scratch, also using Java, without any involvement\
of spring or other third-party applications, but rather built solely on self-written libraries, which\
were prone to bugs and limitations:

CampusOnSpring is a content management system built entirely\
in Java using SpringMVC, JSP and Hibernate.

### Built With

This Spring application is intended to be used in conjunction with Docker alongside an SQL database,
\
therefore an installation of the aforementioned software is required.

### Getting Started

Guides on the Installation third party prerequisites are found here:
* Check your OS and select your [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installation accordingly.
* In addition [MariaDB and (optionally phpMyAdmin)](https://migueldoctor.medium.com/run-mariadb-phpmyadmin-locally-in-3-steps-using-docker-6b5912ff37c9) might be valuable \
  resources as well as mandatory software to configure a database connection.

### Installation (continuation coming soon...)

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/queerzard/CampusOnSpring.git
```
